## LionBot (formerly StudyLion) - Discord Study & Productivity Bot

LionBot is a Discord bot that tracks members' study and work time while offering members the ability to view their statistics and use productivity tools such as: To-do lists, pomodoro timers, reminders, and much more.

Join the [**support server**](https://discord.gg/the-study-lions-780195610154237993) to contact us if you need help configuring the bot on your server, or start a [**discussion**](https://github.com/LionBots/LionBot/discussions "disscussion") to report issues and bugs.



### The Idea


In the past couple of years, we noticed a new trend on Discord â€“ instead of being a platform designed only for gamers, many students joined it as well, forming communities dedicated to studying and working together.



This bot was founder by [Ari Horesh](https://www.youtube.com/arihoresh) (@AriHoresh) to support these forming study communities and allow students all over the world to study better.

### Self Hosting

You can self-host and fork the bot using the following steps, but beware that we do not provide support for self-hosted instances. If you are interested in a privately managed instance (affordable paid service), contact Ari at contact@arihoresh.com

Follow the steps below to self-host the bot.
- Clone the repo recursively (which makes sure to include the cmdClient submodule, otherwise you need to initialise it separately) 
-  Install the requirements from `requirements.txt` 
- Install Postgresql, and setup a database with the schema given in `data/schema.sql` 
-  Copy `config/example-bot.conf` to `config/bot.conf`, filling in the appropriate information, including database connection arguments. 
- Start the bot from the top level `run.py`.

We do not offer support for self-hosted bots, the code is provided as is without warranty of any kind.
